# Challenge 5 Documentation


After reading the challenge question, i realised i had to somehow access the assignment info from some server hosting the lms website. Next, I did some googling on how to do 
just that. I found about this 'requests' library available for python. Afterwards, i started trying out code snippets from geeksforgeeks requests library gudie
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-requests-in-python-for-windows-linux-mac).

Then i started trying get requests on github trying to log in, only to realise that github uses some 'key' to authorise that action. Later i found out nearly every other 
modern website uses this kind of authorisation. So, on more googling i found out this website by Stephen Brennan (https://brennan.io/2016/03/02/logging-in-with-requests/),
which was exactly what i needed. He also worked on a similar project, to web-scrape his school's website to automate things.

now, i tried to use his code snippets, while modifying them (since there might have been differences in webpage structures of his and my school), but that didnt work. At last,
i realised i just needed to just copy his code and run it, just changing the login page url. Because apparently, the 'logintoken' was in a 'form' element with class as 'hidden'
in both cases (his and mine). 

Upon more research and some help from chatGPT, i wrote 'httprequests.py' (should be included in this flolder) as my testing python file to try to login into lms webpage.
