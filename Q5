# Challenge 5 Documentation


After reading the challenge question, i realised i had to somehow access the assignment info from some server hosting the lms website. Next, I did some googling on how to do 
just that. I found about this 'requests' library available for python. Afterwards, i started trying out code snippets from geeksforgeeks requests library gudie
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-requests-in-python-for-windows-linux-mac).

Then i started trying get requests on github trying to log in, only to realise that github uses some 'key' to authorise that action. Later i found out nearly every other 
modern website uses this kind of authorisation. So, on more googling i found out this website by Stephen Brennan (https://brennan.io/2016/03/02/logging-in-with-requests/),
which was exactly what i needed. He also worked on a similar project, to web-scrape his school's website to automate things.

now, i tried to use his code snippets, while modifying them (since there might have been differences in webpage structures of his and my school), but that didnt work. At last,
i realised i just needed to just copy his code and run it, just changing the login page url. Because apparently, the 'logintoken' was in a 'form' element with class as 'hidden'
in both cases (his and mine). 

Upon more research and some help from chatGPT, i wrote 'httprequests.py' (should be included in this flolder) as my testing python file to try to login into lms webpage. I was
trying to input the login credentials and get the response and wrote it in another file named 'testing.html' to see what it returned.

Now, having run this file multiple times, changing something or even without changing anything, hoping it would just work, it didnt work. So, on more googling i found another 
library but this time it was a javascript library. Again, this lib claimed to do exactly what i was trying to do. It too claimed to login to a website using get requests. Now
not bring very familiar with js, i still tried to run it, but it didnt work. So i switched back to python. 

Finally, i discovered 'playright' library in python (i had found a similar lib in js, called puppeteer, but being unfamiliar with js i didnt go with it). Now using playright,
i could finally login and get the course content from lms.
